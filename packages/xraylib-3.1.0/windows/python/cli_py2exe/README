The fully contained executable was built using py2exe, using the setup.py file found in this folder, on a Windows XP 64-bit system.

Running it as:
	
	python setup.py py2exe

produces the dist folder containing xraylib.exe as well as the Documentation and the Microsoft Visual Studio run time dll, which is necessary for the python interpreter.

The python version that was used is 2.7

Next, we built an installation package using NSIS
